<- Ship ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ship represents the field in whizh ships move.

The privates properties of the ship are as follow: name, max_shell, shell,
default_shield, shield, speed, agility, width, height.

Its constructor function uses its parent class's one (OnScreen class), but
needs other keys in the kwarray, which are the private propertie described on
top.

The beginningOfTurn() method sets the shield property to the default_shield
at the beginning of the game.

It also has a function stayInTheMap to check if it is still in the scope of the
arena. If it goes out, the ship is destroyed.

The shipIsShot decrements the shell property and then destroys the ship if
it goes under 0.

The move method changes the position_x and the position_y properties.

The getName(), getShell(), getShiel(), getSpeed(), getAgility(), getWidth()
and getHeight() properties return the matching properties.
